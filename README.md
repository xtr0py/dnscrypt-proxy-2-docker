This is a Docker image containing [DNSCrypt Proxy 2.x](https://github.com/jedisct1/dnscrypt-proxy). You can use this to set up a DNS proxy on your local network which resolves queries using DNSCrypt or DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH) rather than sending plaintext DNS queries over the Internet.

This image comes with a configuration which:
- [x] Looks up queries via DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH) and DNSCrypt
- [x] Use only DNSSEC, no logging, no filtering servers
- [x] Listens on all interfaces
- [x] Excludes Cloudflare, Google, and Yandex servers
- [x] updated DNScrypt-proxy 2.0.45 
- [x] Uses public-resolvers v3


You can run with this configuration:

`docker run -p 53:53/udp xtr0py/dnscrypt-proxy-2-docker`

If you wish to override the configuration:

`docker run -p 53:53/udp  -v /path/to/dnscrypt-proxy.toml:/config/dnscrypt-proxy.toml xtr0py/dnscrypt-proxy-2-docker`
